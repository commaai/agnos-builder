# agnos-builder

This is the buidler repo for AGNOS, our Ubuntu based OS. AGNOS runs on the comma three devkit and [comma 3X](https://comma.ai/shop/comma-3x).

NOTE: the `edk2_tici` and `agnos-firmware` submodules are internal, private repos.

## Development

These tools are developed on and targeted for Ubuntu 20.04.

Run once to set things up:
```sh
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/commaai/agnos-builder.git

cd agnos-builder
git submodule update --init agnos-kernel-sdm845
./tools/extract_tools.sh
```

Building
```
./build_kernel.sh
./build_system.sh
```

Flashing to a comma 3/3X:
```
./flash_kernel.sh
./flash_system.sh
```

A comma 3/3X is helpful for working on AGNOS, but there's still lots of interesting work to do without one.

### Roadmap

AGNOS's main priority is to provide a stable platform to [openpilot](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot).
The second priority is to be a good platform for all sorts of [robotics development](https://blog.comma.ai/a-drive-in-the-office/).

Now that AGNOS is good at running openpilot, the next things up are:
* speedups: build system, CI, boot time, etc.
* cleanups: Android kernel to mainline kernel
* open source: AGNOS started with a bunch blobs for various things, like the bootloaders and weston. We want to move everything we can to open source versions built in this repo.

Some concrete things on the roadmap:
- [ ] <10s boot time https://github.com/commaai/agnos-builder/issues/110, https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/issues/30894
- [ ] make the image tiny, for fast updating and flashing https://github.com/commaai/agnos-builder/issues/225
- [ ] update to Ubuntu 24.04 https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/issues/32386
- [ ] mainline Linux kernel https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/issues/32386
- [ ] fully open source 
  - [ ] anything from `agnos-firmware`: XBL, ABL, etc.
  - [ ] open source Weston https://github.com/commaai/agnos-builder/issues/16
