# Ubuntu 24.04 + "old" weston

The following need to work together in Ubuntu 24.04 (noble):
- "old" weston
- libwayland
- qtwayland
- qt

The "old" weston is built with:
- libwayland-dev_1.9.0-1
- libwayland-server_1.9.0-1
- libwayland-client_1.9.0-1
- libwayland-cursor_1.9.0-1

These are roughly from Xenial (16.04 - https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/xenial/arm64/libwayland-dev/1.9.0-1).

In Ubuntu 20.04 (focal) even if libwayland is 1.18.0-1, the protocol between
the server (1.9.0-1) and client (1.18.0-1) was still compatible. Unfortunately,
this is not the case anymore in Ubuntu 24.04 (noble), where libwayland 1.22.0
is not compatible anymore with 1.9.0.

Because of this:
- libwayland-*_1.9.0-1 packages can't be installed anymore from noble, but a
custom deb has been built (libwayland-1.9.0-1.deb) - this includes all
libwayland packages in one package
- libwayland has a dependency (libffi6)
- libwayland-1.9.0-1.deb can be rebuilt with `build-libwayland-deb.sh`

Also, Qt 5.15 from Ubuntu 24.04 (noble) doesn't compile with these old
dependencies, 5.12 being the last major being able to be compiled, so:
- a custom qt-5.12.8.deb has been built, since qt from focal has a lot of
dependencies not existing in Ubuntu 24.04 (noble)
- qt has two non-qt related dependencies (libicu66, libssl1.1)
- qt-5.12.8.deb can be rebuilt with `build-qt-deb.sh`

The dependencies for the two custom debs can be downloaded from Launchpad:
```
curl -LO https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+archive/primary/+files/libffi6_3.2.1-8_arm64.deb
curl -LO https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+archive/primary/+files/libicu66_66.1-2ubuntu2.1_arm64.deb
curl -LO https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+archive/primary/+files/libssl1.1_1.1.1f-1ubuntu2.22_arm64.deb
```
\* libffi6_armhf is also needed, but already exits in libs32

# When updating weston & removing custom debs
After removing qt-5.12.8.deb add these back:
```
libqt5opengl5-dev \
libqt5sql5-sqlite \
libqt5svg5-dev \
libqt5multimedia5-plugins \
qml-module-qtquick2 \
qtbase5-dev \
qtchooser \
qt5-qmake \
qtbase5-dev-tools \
qtbase5-private-dev \
qtdeclarative5-dev \
qtdeclarative5-private-dev \
qtlocation5-dev \
qtmultimedia5-dev \
qtpositioning5-dev \
qtwayland5 \
```

In case of uncertainty, qt5-default was a metapackage for:
```
qtbase5-dev
qtchooser
qt5-qmake
qtbase5-dev-tools
```
More info: https://packages.ubuntu.com/focal/qt5-default

After removing libwayland-1.9.0-1.deb add these back:
```
libwayland-client0:armhf \
libwayland-cursor0:armhf \
libwayland-server0:armhf \
libwayland-dev \
```
